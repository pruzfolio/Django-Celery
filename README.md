# Celery Learning Roadmap

## 1. Beginner Level

### Topics:
- [ ] **Introduction to Celery**
  - [ ] What is Celery? Use cases and benefits.
  - [ ] Overview of message brokers (RabbitMQ, Redis).
  - [ ] Installing Celery and setting it up in a Django project.

- [ ] **Basic Celery Configuration**
  - [ ] `celery.py` setup in a Django project.
  - [ ] Configuring Celery to use Redis as a broker.
  - [ ] Writing and running your first Celery task.

- [ ] **Executing Basic Tasks**
  - [ ] Synchronous vs asynchronous task execution.
  - [ ] Using `apply_async` with simple arguments.

### Suggestions:
- [ ] Start with Celery's Getting Started guide.
- [ ] Use Redis as the message broker for simplicity.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Add a background email sender to a Django project:**
  - [ ] Use `django.core.mail` to send emails asynchronously with Celery.
  - [ ] Trigger email sending upon user registration.

## 2. Intermediate Level

### Topics:
- [ ] **Periodic Tasks with Celery-Beat**
  - [ ] Installing and configuring `celery-beat` for periodic tasks.
  - [ ] Creating periodic tasks (e.g., run every hour or daily).

- [ ] **Task Results Backend**
  - [ ] Configuring Celery with a results backend (e.g., Redis, database).
  - [ ] Retrieving and storing task results.

- [ ] **Task Retry and Error Handling**
  - [ ] Using retry for task failures.
  - [ ] Setting maximum retries and exponential backoff.

- [ ] **Chaining and Grouping Tasks**
  - [ ] Task workflows using chains and groups.
  - [ ] Executing multiple tasks in parallel or sequentially.

- [ ] **Monitoring Tasks**
  - [ ] Using Flower to monitor Celery tasks.
  - [ ] Tracking task status and progress.

### Suggestions:
- [ ] Combine Celery with Django signals to trigger tasks.
- [ ] Experiment with `celery-beat` for scheduling periodic jobs.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Build a data scraping app:**
  - [ ] Scrape data from a public API or website.
  - [ ] Schedule scraping tasks to run hourly using `celery-beat`.
  - [ ] Store the results in a PostgreSQL database.

## 3. Advanced Level

### Topics:
- [ ] **Advanced Task Handling**
  - [ ] Using task priorities for execution order.
  - [ ] Soft and hard time limits for tasks.

- [ ] **Custom Task Classes**
  - [ ] Creating custom base tasks for reusable logic.
  - [ ] Implementing shared tasks for multi-app projects.

- [ ] **Task Serialization**
  - [ ] Custom serializers for task input/output.
  - [ ] Using JSON or Pickle for complex data.

- [ ] **Optimizing Celery Performance**
  - [ ] Optimizing worker concurrency and prefetching.
  - [ ] Using different queues for task prioritization.

- [ ] **Scaling Celery**
  - [ ] Scaling workers horizontally.
  - [ ] Configuring multiple brokers for high availability.

- [ ] **Django Integration with Celery**
  - [ ] Running Celery with Django models (e.g., ORM queries in tasks).
  - [ ] Avoiding pitfalls with lazy objects like `request.user`.

### Suggestions:
- [ ] Explore large-scale Celery setups and high-performance configurations.
- [ ] Study Celery documentation on scaling and worker management.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Build a video processing system:**
  - [ ] Allow users to upload videos.
  - [ ] Use Celery tasks to transcode videos into multiple resolutions.
  - [ ] Notify users via email when the task completes.

## 4. Professional Level

### Topics:
- [ ] **Real-Time Features with WebSockets**
  - [ ] Integrating Celery with Django Channels for real-time notifications.
  - [ ] Pushing task status updates to the frontend.

- [ ] **Task Orchestration**
  - [ ] Using Celery Canvas for complex workflows (chains, chords, groups).
  - [ ] Dynamically creating workflows based on user input.

- [ ] **Error Handling and Logging**
  - [ ] Custom error handling for task failures.
  - [ ] Using logging frameworks for detailed task logs.

- [ ] **Distributed Systems with Celery**
  - [ ] Setting up Celery in a multi-node architecture.
  - [ ] High availability using RabbitMQ/Redis clusters.

- [ ] **Task Result Expiry and Cleanup**
  - [ ] Automatically expiring old task results.
  - [ ] Writing cleanup scripts for stale tasks.

- [ ] **Security Best Practices**
  - [ ] Securing Celery tasks with task whitelists.
  - [ ] Preventing task injection attacks.

### Suggestions:
- [ ] Learn how to deploy Celery with production tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
- [ ] Explore distributed task queues in production scenarios.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Build a multi-tenant notification system:**
  - [ ] Features: Email, SMS, and push notifications.
  - [ ] Use Celery to manage notifications for multiple tenants.
  - [ ] Implement real-time status updates using Django Channels.

## Project Ideas Across Levels

- **Beginner:** Email Sender with Celery
  - [ ] Add Celery tasks to send welcome emails after user registration.
  
- **Intermediate:** Scheduled Report Generator
  - [ ] Schedule a daily task to generate PDF reports of user activity.
  
- **Advanced:** Background Analytics Processor
  - [ ] Process large datasets (e.g., user activity logs) in the background.
  - [ ] Use Celery tasks to compute and store analytics results.
  
- **Professional:** Real-Time Dashboard with Task Status
